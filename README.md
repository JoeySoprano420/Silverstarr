# Silverstarr (S12) — 

*A dramatic, strongly-typed capsule language that speaks in Corsheigh’s ritual and Innesce’s rigor — and runs only after the stage crew’s Static Interpretation Before Execution (SIBE) locks every bolt.*

---

## Overture: What Silverstarr Is

Silverstarr mixes:

* **Corsheigh’s cinematic directives**
  `capsule … with Trait<…>`, `confirm with [ … ]`, `do with [ … ]`, `say …`, `make capsule from …`, `done`

* **Innesce’s disciplined core**
  `fn`, `let`, `match`, `enum/record`, strong static types, extended **truth** semantics, durations, short-circuit guards, payload enums, deterministic lowering.

**Design pillars**

1. **Capsules-as-program** — top-level, deployable units with trait contracts, declared capabilities, and staged pipelines.
2. **Types-before-magic** — Ada-leaning surface; rich enums/records; obvious coercions; predictable codegen.
3. **Preflight → Commit** — the SIBE engine resolves, validates, optimizes, and **hardens** your program into immutable capsules **before** a single instruction executes.

**Files & Tools**

* Extensions: `.ss12` (primary), `.s12` (alias)
* CLI: `ss12c` to build/lint; `ss12 run file.ss12` to build-and-run.

## 1) Language at a Glance

```ss12
-- comments start with --

import fs, net.tcp as tcp           -- modules, optional aliasing
use Trait<Animate>, Trait<Drawable>  -- bring traits into scope (optional)

capsule "Player" with Trait<Animate>, Trait<Drawable>
confirm with [gpu.draw, fs.read]     -- capabilities this capsule requires
do with [pose: jump, lighting: burst]-- pipeline intents (typed metadata)

say "Player ascends"

record Vec2 { x: f64, y: f64 }

enum EvidenceStrength
  | Weak
  | Moderate
  | Strong(boost: i32)
end

fn dot(a: Vec2, b: Vec2) -> f64 is
  return (a.x * b.x) + (a.y * b.y);
end

fn verdict(ev: EvidenceStrength) -> str is
  match ev is
    case Weak       => yield "deny";
    case Moderate   => yield "negotiate";
    case Strong(b)  => yield b > 3 ? "approve" : "review";
  end
end

fn main() -> i32 is
  let v: EvidenceStrength := Strong(5);
  say verdict(v);                  -- prints "approve"
  return 0;
end
```

**Key constructs**

* `capsule "Name" with Trait<A>, Trait<B>` … `confirm with […]` … `do with […]` … `done`
* Declarations: `fn`, `enum`, `record`, `trait`, `const`, `let`, `import`, `use`
* **truth** type: `True | False | Unknown` (with sugar `t?` ≡ `t == True`)
* Durations: `100ms`, `2s`, `3min`, `4h`, with arithmetic
* Control: `if/elif/else`, `while`, `for` (ranges and arrays), `match` with patterns & guards
* Inline assembly (opt-in, gated): `asm { ... } -> (out: T, ...)`

---

## 2) Types & Values

**Scalars**: `i8/i16/i32/i64`, `u*` siblings, `f32/f64`, `bool`, `truth`, `str`, `duration`.

**truth** is tri-state (`True/False/Unknown`), represented as `i8` (1/0/2).

* Sugar: `t?` valid when `t: truth` → `(t == True)`
* Mixing `truth` and `bool` requires explicit coercion or the sugar; the linter nudges you.

**Collections**

* Fixed arrays: `[T; N]`
* Growable arrays: `Array<T>`
* Records: `record Name { field: Type, ... }`
* Enums (sum types) with payloads:

```ss12
enum Token
  | Ident(name: str)
  | Number(n: f64)
  | Eof
end
```

**Traits** (interfaces):

```ss12
trait Drawable is
  fn draw() -> void;
end
```

**Durations** are first-class (`duration`), lowered to `i64` milliseconds. Arithmetic is unit-aware.

---

## 3) Expressions & Operators

* Arithmetic: `+ - * / %` (ints), `+ - * /` (floats)
* Comparisons: `== != < <= > >=`
* Logic: `&& || !` (short-circuiting)
* Ternary: `cond ? when_true : when_false`
* Ranges: `a..b` (half-open)
* Field access / indexing: `r.x`, `arr[i]`
* Calls: `fn(args…)`. Enum constructors are calls too: `Strong(5)`.

---

## 4) Control Flow

**If / elif / else**

```ss12
if ready? is
  start();
elif retry_count < 3 is
  backoff();
else
  fail();
end
```

**While**

```ss12
while time_left() > 0 is
  tick();
end
```

**For**

* Range with stride: `for i in a..b step k is ... end`
* Array with index & value: `for (i, x) in arr is ... end`
* Array value-only: `for x in arr is ... end`

---

## 5) Pattern Matching (Production Level)

```ss12
match v is
  case 0                    => yield "zero";
  case 1 | 2 | 3            => yield "small";
  case Vec2 { x: 3, y }     => yield "on x=3, y=" + to_str(y);  -- record destructuring with constraint + bind
  case points[2]: p         => yield "3rd point is " + fmt(p); -- index pattern (array/slice)
  case Strong(b) when b>3   => yield "approve";
  case Strong(_)            => yield "review";
  case _                    => yield "other";
end
```

**Highlights**

* **Record patterns**: `Type { x: 3, y }` checks `x==3` then *binds* `y`.
  *Write-through*: bound names are introduced in the surrounding scope when the case fires.

* **Index patterns**: `arr[i]: name` or `arr[2]: p` inside `case` arms binds an element by index for matching.

* **Enum payload patterns**: `Variant(x, _)`, with optional `when` guard.

* **Exhaustiveness**: The compiler enforces it unless `_` is present.

---

## 6) Capsules, Traits, Pipelines

**Capsules** are compilation/binary units with explicit contracts:

```ss12
capsule "Phoenix:Session" with Trait<Init>, Trait<Confirmable>
confirm with [net.tcp, fs.write]
do with [init, confirm]

fn init() -> void is
  say "Session initialized.";
end

fn confirm() -> bool is
  say "Resources confirmed.";
  return true;
end

done
```

* **confirm with \[ … ]**: declare capabilities needed (`fs.read`, `gpu.draw`, `arch.x86`, `time.now`, `net.tcp`, …). SIBE rejects code that calls gated APIs absent a confirming capsule.
* **do with \[k: v, …]**: declarative intents that SIBE validates against trait-known keys (linter warns on unknowns).
* **Immutable capsules**: after SIBE preflight, ABI, code, and pipeline intents are frozen.

**Make & run**

```ss12
fn main() -> i32 is
  make capsule from "Phoenix:Session";
  say "Session live.";
  return 0;
end
```

---

## 7) Inline Assembly (opt-in, guarded)

```ss12
fn rdtsc() -> i64 is
  let t: i64 := asm {
    ; requires confirm with [arch.x86]
    rdtsc
    shl rdx, 32
    or rax, rdx
  } -> (rax: i64);
  return t;
end
```

* Requires `confirm with [arch.x86]` (or other `arch.*`) in some capsule in the build.
* Outputs are named and typed: `} -> (rax: i64, rdx: i64)`
* Treated as **unsafe** islands; SIBE still reasons about them at the boundary.

---

## 8) Standard Library Seeds (capability-gated)

* `say(str)` — print to stdout (always allowed)
* `time.now() -> duration` *(requires a capsule confirming `time.now`)*
* `fs.read(path: str) -> Result<str, ioerr>` *(gated by `fs.read`)*
* `fs.write(path: str, text: str) -> unit` *(gated by `fs.write`)*
* `gpu.draw(model: str) -> unit` *(gated by `gpu.draw`)*
* `net.tcp.connect(addr: str) -> Conn` *(gated by `net.tcp`)*

> **Rule:** You may import a module freely, but **you cannot call** a capability without **some** capsule in the program confirming it. This is validated at preflight and guarded at runtime.

---

## 9) The SIBE Processor Engine

*Static Interpretation Before Execution*

SIBE is Silverstarr’s heart: before anything runs, the engine **interprets statically** and **finalizes** the whole program.

### 9.1 What SIBE Does

1. **Full-program scan & symbol sealing**

   * Parse, resolve imports, check trait conformance, seal names, choose monomorphized instantiations for generics.

2. **Capsule plan**

   * Dedicate virtual registers to **segregate** code/data per capsule; mark ABI boundaries; freeze pipeline intents.

3. **Tokenize to objectized packets**

   * Every command, expression, operator, literal, variable, and type lowers to a typed **packet** (portable IR node).

4. **Foresight & constant folding**

   * Global constant propagation; truth simplification (`Unknown` propagation semantics); ternary lowering; short-circuit branch shaping.

5. **Control-flow normalization**

   * Convert to structured CFG; lower `&&/||` to branches; ensure `match` is single-pass with early exits; enforce exhaustiveness.

6. **Loop work**

   * **Strength-reduce** loop invariants, **unroll** small fixed trip-counts, **peel** first/last iterations when profitable, **vectorize** hot numeric loops where data types align (SIMD packs chosen per target).
   * **Range synthesis**: `a..b step k` becomes stride loops; array iteration becomes indexed loops with bounds checks merged.

7. **Tail calls & tiny inlining**

   * **TCO**: tail calls become frame-reuse jumps (no stack growth).
   * **ABI-safe tiny inline**: ≤N-op, effect-free functions inlined **across capsules** if they don’t breach capability or `extern` boundaries. Immutable capsules remain immutable: SIBE writes the inlined copy into the caller **without** changing the callee artifact.

8. **Dead code elimination**

   * Prune unreachable arms, unused locals, dead capsules (never `make`-d), and pipeline keys unused by any trait.

9. **Vectorization & inline-asm substitution**

   * Recognize idioms (`memcpy`, small reductions) and optionally replace with vetted `asm` snippets **only if** the program already confirms the matching `arch.*` capability.

10. **Full dependency/link resolution**

    * Resolve all symbol references; link external DGM routines (`extern dgm`) and capsule exports; validate that every capability use is justified by some `confirm`.

11. **Hardening & finalization**

    * Freeze capsule ABIs, write immutable metadata, compute content hashes, and **lock** the program image.
    * Any unhandled error becomes a **preflight error**; SIBE refuses to run a program that could crash or stall at known sites.

12. **Auto-scaling**

    * SIBE partitions the whole graph into capsule shards sized to cache/fitting heuristics, schedules optimization passes proportionally, and streams artifacts so projects of **any size** behave like a well-framed TV show on any screen.

**Outcome:** a **Processed Agent** — neither interpreted nor merely compiled, but pre-validated, pre-optimized, **pre-decided** code.

### 9.2 Safety & Guarantees

* No unknown capability calls.
* No unguarded inline assembly.
* No non-exhaustive `match`.
* No unresolved imports or trait methods.
* Deterministic lowering: same source ⇒ same image, byte-for-byte (given same toolchain version/flags).

---

## 10) Semantics & Lowering (Formal)

* **Enums** lower to a stable ABI shape:
  `struct { i32 tag; [N x i64] fields; }` (conservative layout; portable across backends).

* **Records** lower nominally (type name retained in debug meta). Field order is stable.

* **truth** lowers to `i8` (`0=False`, `1=True`, `2=Unknown`). Sugar `t?` → `(t == 1)` early.

* **Short-circuit** `&&/||` become branchy CFG blocks.

* **`match`**: one pass per case, guarded by tests; payload binds via extracts (record fields, enum slots, array indices). Early exit to `match.end`.

* **Durations** become `i64` milliseconds. Mixed arithmetic is rejected unless explicitly coerced.

* **Inline asm** requires a matching `arch.*` capability; SIBE treats outputs as defined, inputs as consumed, and inserts memory clobbers conservatively.

---

## 11) The Dodecagram Link (DGM, base-12)

Silverstarr ships an **automatic linker** for **Dodecagram** (`.dgm`), a base-12 micro-assembly that maps directly to opcodes.

**Digits:** `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 X E` (X=10, E=11)
**Opcodes (example mapping):**

```
0 NOP  1 MOV  2 ADD  3 SUB  4 MUL  5 DIV
6 AND  7 OR   8 XOR  9 NOT  X JMP  E HALT
```

**Format:** opcode | operand1 | operand2 (all base-12)

```dgm
10708   ; MOV R7, 8
20709   ; ADD R7, R9
E       ; HALT
```

**In S12:**

```ss12
extern dgm twice_add {
  1 0 0X    ; MOV R0, 10 (X)
  2 0 1     ; ADD R0, R1
  2 0 2     ; ADD R0, R2
  E
}

fn main() -> i32 is
  say twice_add(7, 5);   -- returns via R0
  return 0;
end
```

* `extern dgm name { … }` declares a callable routine.
* Convention: **R0** is the return value; up to 12 integer args flow in registers `R0..R11`.
* SIBE validates the block and links it as an internal callable.
* Tail-calls to DGM are allowed (frame reuse + immediate return).

---

## 12) CLI, Build, and Layout

```
# compile
ss12c build src/main.ss12 -o build/app.ssvm

# run (build to temp + run)
ss12 run src/main.ss12

# lints only
ss12c lint src/main.ss12
```

**Typical project**

```
/src
  main.ss12
  player.ss12
/traits
  animate.ss12
  drawable.ss12
/dgm
  blit.dgm
```

---

## 13) Linter & Style

* **Scoped pipeline keys** — warn if `do with [k:v]` uses keys unknown to the capsule’s traits.
* **Dead branch** — warn on patterns never matched; unreachable `case`.
* **Shadowing** — warn on local names shadowing outer ones.
* **Truth coercion** — suggest explicit `t?` when mixing `truth` with `bool`.
* **Duration math** — disallow unitless + duration without cast.
* **Index safety** — warn on provable out-of-bounds.
* **Capability drift** — warn if code calls a gated API and **no capsule** confirms it.

Style highlights:

* Use `match` for algebraic cases instead of nested `if`.
* Prefer named records over loose tuples.
* Keep capsule names namespaced: `"Module:Thing"`.

---

## 14) Errors & Diagnostics

* **Preflight (SIBE) errors** stop the build: missing capability, non-exhaustive match, unimplemented trait method, unresolved import, unsafe asm without `arch.*`.
* **Runtime** errors are *rare* (bounds checks, explicit `panic`, external I/O failures wrapped in `Result`).
* Messages are precise: *“capsule 'Phoenix\:Session' requires unknown capability 'gpu.drw' (did you mean 'gpu.draw'?)”*

---

## 15) Observability

* `say` is ubiquitous and stable.
* Records/enums print in a canonical tagged form:
  `{ type: "Vec2", x: 3, y: 9 }`
  `{ type: "EvidenceStrength", tag: "Strong", fields: [5] }`
* Capsule pipeline intents appear in the run header when verbose mode is enabled.

---

## 16) Worked Samples

### 16.1 Capsule Ceremony (Corsheigh soul, Innesce bones)

```ss12
import fs

trait Animate is fn pose(name: str) -> void; end
trait Drawable is fn draw() -> void; end

record Light { kind: str }

capsule "Player" with Trait<Animate>, Trait<Drawable>
confirm with [gpu.draw, fs.read]            -- preflight gates
do with [pose: jump, lighting: burst]

fn pose(name: str) -> void is
  say "Pose = " + name;
end

fn draw() -> void is
  say "Drawn to screen.";
end

fn run_scene() -> void is
  pose("jump");
  draw();
  say "Player ascends";
end

done

fn main() -> i32 is
  say "Initiating ceremony...";
  run_scene();
  return 0;
end
```

### 16.2 Payload Enums + Guards

```ss12
enum EvidenceStrength
  | Weak
  | Moderate
  | Strong(boost: i32)
end

fn decide(ev: EvidenceStrength, urgent: bool) -> str is
  match ev is
    case Weak when !urgent     => yield "deny";
    case Moderate              => yield urgent && true ? "rush-review" : "review";
    case Strong(b) when b > 3  => yield "approve";
    case Strong(_)             => yield "review";
  end
end
```

### 16.3 asm → match (the weld)

```ss12
fn asm_probe() -> i64 is
  let r: i64 := asm {
    mov rax, 42
  } -> (rax: i64);
  return r;
end

fn report() -> str is
  match asm_probe() is
    case 0  => yield "none";
    case 42 => yield "life";
    case _  => yield "other";
  end
end
```

### 16.4 Loops (range stride; array with index)

```ss12
let s: i32 := 0;
for i in 0..10 step 3 is
  s = s + i;                  -- 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 = 18
end

let a: Array<i32> := [5,6,7,8];
let t: i32 := 0;
for (k, x) in a is
  t = t + (k * x);            -- 0*5 + 1*6 + 2*7 + 3*8 = 44
end
```

### 16.5 Record / Index Patterns + Write-through

```ss12
record Vec2 { x: i32, y: i32 }
let v: Vec2 := Vec2 { x: 3, y: 9 };

say match v is
  case Vec2 { x: 3, y } => yield y;   -- binds y into outer scope
  case _                 => yield 0;
end;

say y;                                -- 9 (write-through binding)
```

## 17) Extended Grammar (production)

Only the deltas vs. the “reduced PEG” are shown inline; everything else remains as earlier, with added constructs noted:

## 18) Execution Model & ABI

* **Calling convention (S12 VM)**

  * Arguments pushed right-to-left; return value on top; tail calls reuse frame (TCO).
  * DGM calls pass up to 12 integer args in R0..R11; return in R0.

* **Memory & layout**

  * Records: nominal; fields in declaration order.
  * Enums: tag + payload slab (stable size per enum).
  * Strings: immutable, UTF-8.
  * Arrays: length + contiguous elements.

* **Determinism**

  * Given same compiler version + flags, SIBE emits identical artifacts.

---

## 19) Performance Cheatsheet

* Prefer `for (i, x) in arr` over manual indexing; SIBE fuses bounds checks.
* Use `match` on enums/records; it inlines dispatch.
* Mark tiny helpers; SIBE’s tiny inliner will fold them across capsule lines if ABI-safe.
* Use durations natively; they lower to `i64` milliseconds.

---

## 20) Why Base-12 DGM?

* **Packing**: factors of 2,3,4,6; good for instruction fields.
* **Compactness**: denser than decimal, friendlier than raw binary.
* **Aesthetic**: plays with Silverstarr’s “dodecagram” motif.

---

## 21) Frequently Noted Edges

* Records/enums **print** as tagged maps (canonical, JSON-ish).
* Field/index access are first-class in expressions **and** patterns.
* `time.now` / `fs.*` calls are runtime-guarded **and** preflight-validated: forget to confirm them and you get a clear error.
* `match` supports constants, `_`, `when` guards, enum payload binds, record destructuring, and index binds.

---

## 22) Putting It All Together — a Final, Cohesive Example

```ss12
import fs, net.tcp as tcp

trait Init is fn init() -> void; end
trait Confirmable is fn confirm() -> bool; end
trait Drawable is fn draw() -> void; end

record Vec2 { x: i32, y: i32 }

enum EvidenceStrength
  | Weak
  | Moderate
  | Strong(boost: i32)
end

capsule "Forge:Session" with Trait<Init>, Trait<Confirmable>, Trait<Drawable>
confirm with [fs.read, fs.write, gpu.draw, time.now]
do with [init, confirm, pose: rise, lighting: burst]

fn init() -> void is
  say "Session init @ " + to_str(time.now());
end

fn confirm() -> bool is
  say "Confirm gates OK.";
  return true;
end

fn draw() -> void is
  say "Draw from Forge.";
end

done

extern dgm twiddle {
  1 0 5    ; MOV R0, 5
  4 0 0    ; MUL R0, R0
  E
}

fn score(ev: EvidenceStrength, p: Vec2) -> i32 is
  -- record + payload + guard magic

## Curtain Call

Silverstarr’s promise is simple: **write cinematic, typed rituals**; SIBE does the ruthless engineering — folds constants, unrolls loops, vectorizes hot paths, enforces capability law, and **freezes** immutable capsules — all **before** the first instruction runs. The result is a **Processed Agent**: predictable, portable, and ready to hit its mark every time.

## _____

Silverstarr is a fascinating beast—here’s the full breakdown in straight-up programmer terms, no fluff:

---

### ⚙️ Compiled or Interpreted?

**Compiled.**  
Silverstarr uses a custom engine called **SIBE (Static Interpretation Before Execution)**. It’s not just a compiler—it’s a full preflight system that:
- Parses and validates everything
- Optimizes aggressively
- Locks the binary into an **immutable, ABI-safe artifact**

Once SIBE finishes, the result is a **pre-decided, hardened binary**. No interpretation, no runtime surprises.

---

### 🧭 Programming Paradigms

Silverstarr blends:
- **Strong static typing** (like Ada or Rust)
- **Trait-based polymorphism** (like Rust’s traits or Go’s interfaces)
- **Capsule modularity** (like sealed modules with declared capabilities)
- **Declarative intent** (you describe what the capsule does, not just how)

It’s not object-oriented or functional in the traditional sense—it’s **contract-first and capability-gated**.

---

### 🚀 Compile Time Performance

**Fast and scalable.**  
SIBE auto-shards large programs into capsule-sized chunks, optimizes in parallel, and streams artifacts. Even big projects behave like “a well-framed TV show on any screen”.

It does constant folding, loop unrolling, vectorization, and dead code elimination—all before runtime.

---

### 🏎 Runtime Performance

**Very fast.**  
Because everything is pre-optimized and locked down:
- Loops are vectorized
- Tail calls are reused (TCO)
- Small functions are inlined across capsules
- Bounds checks are fused

Runtime is lean, predictable, and ABI-stable. It’s built for **low-latency, high-reliability execution**.

---

### 🧮 Typing Discipline

**Statically typed.**  
Types are resolved at compile time. You get:
- Rich enums and records
- Tri-state `truth` type (`True`, `False`, `Unknown`)
- Duration-aware arithmetic
- Explicit coercions between types

No dynamic typing, no runtime type errors.

---

### 🛡 Safety Model

**Extremely safe.**  
Silverstarr enforces:
- No system calls unless explicitly confirmed
- No unsafe inline assembly unless gated
- Exhaustive `match` statements
- No unresolved imports or trait methods
- Deterministic lowering (same source = same binary)

If anything’s missing or ambiguous, SIBE halts the build. Runtime errors are rare and wrapped in `Result` types.

---

### 🔄 Compared to Traditional Programming

Silverstarr flips the model:
- Instead of “write code, then debug,” you **declare intent, confirm capabilities, and preflight everything.**
- You don’t just import modules—you **apply for permission** to use system features.
- You don’t just run code—you **lock it into immutable capsules**.

It’s like programming with a compiler that acts as a **security auditor, optimizer, and ritual enforcer** all in one.

---

### 🎯 Use Cases

Silverstarr is ideal for:
- **Secure systems programming** (embedded, OS-level, capsule runtimes)
- **Game engine modules** (GPU draw, input handling, simulation loops)
- **Protocol design** (network capsules, trait contracts)
- **Educational runtimes** (safe, predictable behavior)
- **Symbolic or ceremonial tooling** (if you want to animate feedback or lineage)

It’s especially powerful for **modular, capability-aware systems** where safety and clarity matter.

---

### 🥇 Advantages Over Other Languages

- **Immutable binaries**: Once built, they can’t be tampered with.
- **Capability gating**: No accidental system calls.
- **Trait contracts**: Enforces interface conformance.
- **Preflight optimization**: No runtime surprises.
- **Inline assembly (guarded)**: Performance when you need it, safety when you don’t.
- **Base-12 micro-assembly (DGM)**: Optional, but compact and expressive for low-level routines.

---

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Languages in Its Class

Silverstarr sits in a niche between:

| Language      | Shared Traits                          |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Rust**      | Safety, traits, capability gating      |
| **Ada**       | Strong typing, predictable behavior    |
| **Zig**       | Manual control, compile-time safety    |
| **TypeScript**| Trait-like interfaces, declarative style |
| **Wasm**      | Immutable binaries, sandboxed execution |
| **Nim**       | Fast compile times, expressive syntax  |

But Silverstarr’s **capsule model + SIBE engine** make it stand apart. It’s not just a language—it’s a **preflight system for secure, cinematic code**.

---

Silverstarr’s error handling is built around **preflight validation** and **runtime safety wrappers**, making it one of the most predictable and secure languages in its class. Let’s break it down:

---

### 🛠 Error Management in Silverstarr

#### 1. **Preflight Errors (Compile-Time)**
Handled by the **SIBE engine** before any code runs:
- **Missing capability**: If you call `fs.read()` without confirming `fs.read`, SIBE halts the build.
- **Non-exhaustive `match`**: You must cover all enum cases unless you use `_`.
- **Unimplemented trait methods**: If a capsule claims a trait but skips a method, it’s rejected.
- **Unsafe inline assembly without gating**: You must confirm the architecture (e.g. `arch.x86`) before using `asm`.
- **Unresolved imports or symbols**: Any missing reference stops the build.

These are **precise and descriptive**. Example:
```text
capsule 'Phoenix:Session' requires unknown capability 'gpu.drw' (did you mean 'gpu.draw'?)
```

#### 2. **Runtime Errors**
Rare, but handled gracefully:
- **Bounds checks**: Arrays and ranges are guarded.
- **I/O failures**: Wrapped in `Result<T, ioerr>` types.
- **Explicit panics**: You can trigger a panic manually, but it’s discouraged.

Example:
```silverstarr
fn read_file(path: str) -> Result<str, ioerr> is
  return fs.read(path); -- requires confirm with [fs.read]
end
```

---

### 🎯 Use Cases for Silverstarr

Silverstarr shines in environments where **modularity, safety, and clarity** are critical. Here are some real-world examples:

#### 1. **Secure Systems Programming**
- Embedded firmware with locked-down capabilities
- OS-level modules that declare exactly what hardware they touch

#### 2. **Game Engine Capsules**
- `Drawable`, `Animate`, and `Input` traits for rendering and control
- GPU draw calls gated by `confirm with [gpu.draw]`

#### 3. **Protocol Design**
- Network capsules that confirm `net.tcp` or `net.udp`
- Trait contracts for handshake, confirm, and transmit

#### 4. **Educational Runtimes**
- Safe environments for teaching systems programming
- Capsules that simulate file access, drawing, and timing with full traceability

#### 5. **Symbolic Tooling**
- Animated CLI feedback
- Debuggers that show trait lineage, capability flow, and intent metadata

---

### 🧪 Example Capsule: Game Module

```silverstarr
trait Drawable is fn draw() -> void; end

capsule "Player" with Trait<Drawable>
  confirm with [gpu.draw]
  fn draw() -> void is
    say "Drawing player sprite";
  end
done
```

This capsule:
- Implements `Drawable`
- Confirms GPU access
- Locks the binary before runtime

---

Silverstarr’s model is like **Rust meets Ada**, but with a **capsule-first mindset**. You don’t just write code—you **declare what it does**, **prove it’s safe**, and **lock it down** before it ever runs.

## ✅ Best Practices for Error Management in Silverstarr

Silverstarr’s error model is built around **preflight validation** and **runtime safety wrappers**, enforced by the SIBE engine. Here’s how to handle errors like a pro:

### 1. **Declare Capabilities Explicitly**
Always use `confirm with [...]` to declare system features your capsule needs. If you forget, SIBE halts the build.

```silverstarr
confirm with [fs.read, gpu.draw]
```

### 2. **Use `Result<T, E>` for I/O and External Calls**
Wrap risky operations like file access or network calls in `Result`.

```silverstarr
fn read_file(path: str) -> Result<str, ioerr> is
  return fs.read(path); -- safe, gated
end
```

### 3. **Exhaustive `match` Statements**
Cover all enum cases or use `_` as a fallback. SIBE enforces this.

```silverstarr
match ev is
  case Weak => yield "deny";
  case Moderate => yield "review";
  case Strong(b) => yield b > 3 ? "approve" : "review";
end
```

### 4. **Guard Inline Assembly**
Only use `asm {}` inside capsules that confirm the matching architecture (e.g. `arch.x86`). Otherwise, it’s blocked.

### 5. **Avoid Runtime Panics**
Use `Result`, `match`, and guards instead of panicking. Runtime errors are rare and discouraged.

---

## 🎯 Detailed Use Case: Game Engine Capsule

Let’s say you’re building a `Player` capsule for a game engine. It needs to draw graphics and read a config file.

```silverstarr
trait Drawable is fn draw() -> void; end

capsule "Player" with Trait<Drawable>
  confirm with [gpu.draw, fs.read]

  fn draw() -> void is
    let config: Result<str, ioerr> := fs.read("player.cfg");
    match config is
      case Ok(text) => say "Loaded config: " + text;
      case Err(_) => say "Failed to load config.";
    end;
    say "Drawing player sprite";
  end
done
```

### What This Capsule Does:
- Declares it needs GPU and file access
- Wraps file read in a `Result`
- Uses `match` to handle success/failure
- Implements the `Drawable` trait
- Locks into an immutable binary after SIBE preflight

This is a **safe, modular, and predictable unit**—perfect for runtime integration.

### 🧠 What Makes Silverstarr Unique

- **Capsule-first design**: You don’t just write code—you declare what it does, what it needs, and what traits it fulfills.
- **Capability gating**: You must explicitly confirm access to system features like `fs.read`, `gpu.draw`, or `arch.x86`.
- **Immutable binaries**: Once compiled, the binary is locked and ABI-safe. No runtime surprises.
- **SIBE engine**: Performs static interpretation, optimization, and validation before execution. It’s like combining Clang, Rustc, and a security auditor.

---

### 🧪 Specific Use Case: Secure Game Engine Module

Let’s say you’re building a `Player` capsule that draws graphics and reads a config file:

```silverstarr
trait Drawable is fn draw() -> void; end

capsule "Player" with Trait<Drawable>
  confirm with [gpu.draw, fs.read]

  fn draw() -> void is
    let config: Result<str, ioerr> := fs.read("player.cfg");
    match config is
      case Ok(text) => say "Loaded config: " + text;
      case Err(_) => say "Failed to load config.";
    end;
    say "Drawing player sprite";
  end
done
```

This capsule:
- Declares its traits and capabilities
- Wraps I/O in a `Result`
- Uses exhaustive `match`
- Locks into an immutable binary after SIBE preflight

Compare that to C/C++ where you’d manually manage headers, memory, and error codes—or Rust, which gives safety but not capsule-level gating.

---
